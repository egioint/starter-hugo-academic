abstract: The non-orthogonal coexistence between the enhanced mobile broadband
  (eMBB) and the ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) in the
  downlink of a multi-cell massive MIMO system is investigated in this work. We
  provide a unified information-theoretic framework blending an
  infinite-blocklength analysis of the eMBB spectral efficiency (SE) in the
  ergodic regime with a finite-blocklength analysis of the URLLC error
  probability. Puncturing (PUNC) and superposition coding (SPC) are considered
  as alternative coexistence strategies to deal with the inter-service
  interference. eMBB and URLLC performances are then evaluated over different
  precoding techniques and power control schemes, by accounting for imperfect
  channel state information knowledge at the base stations, pilot-based
  estimation overhead, spatially correlated channels, and the structure of the
  radio frame. Simulation results reveal that SPC is, in many operating regimes,
  superior to PUNC in providing higher SE for the eMBB yet achieving the target
  reliability for the URLLC with high probability. However, PUNC turns to be
  necessary to preserve the URLLC performance in scenarios where the multi-user
  interference cannot be satisfactorily alleviated.The non-orthogonal

  alt_text: "eMBB services (orange links) require high-peak data-rate and stable
    connectivity, and include most of the everyday usage applications:
    entertainment, multimedia, web-sur\fng, etc. URLLC services (blue links)
    require an one-way radio latency of 1 ms with 99.999% success probability,
    and include real-time and time-critical applications, e.g., augmented
    reality, cellular vehicle-to-everything (C- V2X) use cases for intelligent
